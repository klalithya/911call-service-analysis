# 911call-service-analysis
Overview of this project, I used Spark RDD and Spark SQL in this project to undertake comprehensive data analysis, using sophisticated SQL functions to count values and look at combinations within target columns for further in-depth understanding.

I completed a variety of data transformation and preprocessing activities, such as feature selection, data cleaning, and model training. In order to improve comprehension of the data, I concentrated on decision tree classification in addition to feature importance analysis and visualization.


I also increased the effectiveness of emergency response by giving high-priority calls precedence. I used PySpark to speed up implementation and extract useful information from patterns found.
